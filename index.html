        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a happy and loving cat dad and software developer. I'm deticated to my family life, coffee, cats, computer and daily walks.
             I deeply enjoy learning and developing my skills so I can afford a house with lots of stairs for my cats.
              I love to day dream about the future and wonder what amazing technologies and innovations I'll get to see in my lifetime.
               I also wonder what amazing technologies and innovations I'll get to be a part of before I go.</p>

    <div class="aboutMe2 about">
        <p>In order to get those stairs for my cats I started teaching myself code in 2018. I grew up a sports kid but I gravitated towards 
            coding when my brilliant tech-minded friends started to rub off on me. The learning process was slow at first but gradually that 
            process started to pick up steam as I genuinely enjoyed the grind of learning. I love coding and I love it's endless amount of content 
            to learn.</p>

    <div class="aboutMe3 about">
        <p>These days I look forward to starting new projects and taking on new roles in the world of software. I'm excited for what the 
            future holds and what new brilliant tech-minded friends I'll have the pleasure to colaborate with.
